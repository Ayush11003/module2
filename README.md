# MyToken Solidity Contract
The MyToken Solidity contract is a basic example of a token implementation on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows you to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens for a simple token named "Ayush" with the abbreviation "ayu".

## Features
Minting: You can create new tokens and add them to a specific Ethereum address.
Burning: You can destroy existing tokens by deducting them from a specific Ethereum address.

### Usage
1.Deploy the MyToken contract on an Ethereum development environment.
2.Mint Tokens: Call the mint function on the deployed contract instance, providing the Ethereum address where tokens will be minted and the amount of tokens to mint.
3.Burn Tokens: Call the burn function on the deployed contract instance, providing the Ethereum address from which tokens will be burned and the amount of tokens to burn.
#### Requirements

Ethereum Development Environment: To deploy and interact with the contract, you'll need an Ethereum development environment. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

##### Note
This contract is a simplified example for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, additional features like access control, events, and error handling would be crucial for security and usability.
